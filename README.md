- the robot will move forward for 1 minute
- every time it detects a bug, it will stop
- if the bug is a pest/bad : LED yellow
- the car will move straight over the bug
- if the bug is good : LED green
- the car will move to the right and then to the left (move around the bug)

- it will take constant pictures and constantly compare to the dataset
- as soon as it detects something it will stop

- push dataset on github
- clone repo to rasp pi
- train dataset using opencv

- we will have a numerical value corresponding to good/bad of a bug
- use tensorflow to train the model
